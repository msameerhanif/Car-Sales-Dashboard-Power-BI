# Car-Sales-Dashboard-Power-BI
## Project Description
I developed this interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize Toyota’s global car sales and revenue across different countries and models. The dashboard is designed with a clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy to navigate and extract insights.

## Dataset used
- <a href = "https://github.com/msameerhanif/Car-Sales-Dashboard-Power-BI/blob/main/Car_Sales_Data.csv">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs) This Dashboard Answers
- What is the total revenue compared to the previous year?
- How is monthly revenue performing against last year (growth/decline)?
- Which are the top-selling cars by units sold?
- Which models are the most expensive (highest price per unit)?
- How many cars were sold across different countries, and what revenue did they generate?
- What is the quantity sold by sales channel (Wholesale, Dealership, Online)?
- How do yearly sales (QTY & Revenue) compare over the past years?

## Built visualizations:
- Monthly revenue comparison chart (current vs. PY).
- Card visual for total revenue vs. PY.
- Car images with sales quantities for top-selling models.
- Country-wise sales table with revenue details.
- Donut chart for channel-wise sales distribution.
- Bar chart for year-over-year quantity sold.

## Project Insights:
- Total Revenue: $1.13B this year vs. $0.90B last year → Growth observed.
- Top-Selling Cars: Vitz (2,598 units), Corolla (2,465), Prius (2,254), Hilux (2,102).
- Most Expensive Cars: Corolla Cross ($78,548), Land Cruiser ($77,012).
- Country-wise Revenue Leader: The United States generated the highest revenue ($58.7M) despite selling fewer cars compared to some other countries.
- Sales by Channel: Wholesale dominates (44%), followed by Online (22%), and Dealership (33%).
- Yearly Sales Trend: Quantity sold has remained consistent around 3.0K–3.1K across 2020–2023.
- Designed an interactive and user-friendly dashboard with drill-through options for specific models.

## Final Conclusion:

This Power BI dashboard effectively highlights Toyota’s global sales performance across models, regions, and channels. Revenue has grown compared to the previous year, with strong contributions from Vitz, Corolla, and Prius models. While the United States leads in revenue, sales are well-distributed globally. Wholesale remains the largest sales channel, but online sales are also gaining traction. The dashboard empowers Toyota’s decision-makers to track growth, identify profitable models, and analyze market trends for strategic planning.
